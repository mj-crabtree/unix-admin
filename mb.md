- for each lab you can change the lab value in the url e.g. lab=02 for lab 02
- lab 07 requires a slightly different url which should be included in the corresponding logbook. if it isn't let me know and i'll send it over.
- the platform isn't _perfect_ but it's mostly functional. i've only encountered a few snags here and there
- the labs were originally written by someone who doesn't speak english as a first language but they're fine for the most part. again, any issues either get in touch or refer to my logbooks for answers
